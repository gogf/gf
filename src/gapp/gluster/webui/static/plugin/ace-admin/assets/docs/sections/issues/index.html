		 <h3 class="info-title smaller">1. Webkit browsers</h3>
		 <div class="info-section">
		    <ul class="info-list list-unstyled">
				<li>
					Webkit browers have a problem especially when resizing window due to over-optimization.
					<br />
					They sometimes don't properly redraw layout or apply CSS property changes
					and the workaround is to force redrawing or recalculating properties
					for example by hiding and re-showing an element.
					<br />
					This also may not work every time.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Webkit browsers have a fixed CSS z-index issue.
					<br />
					According to:
					<br />
					<span class="text-info">http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/09/Stacking-Changes-Coming-to-position-fixed-elements</span>
					<br />
					Chrome has decided to choose a different approach than what's mentioned in standard specs.
					<br />
					So now with Firefox and IE,
					a tooltip, popover or dropdown menu inside content area goes above fixed sidebar,
					but below <b>.hover</b> submenus or when sidebar is minimized.
					<br />
					But in Chrome, popovers, tooltips etc go below fixed sidebar.
				
					<div class="hr hr-6"></div>
				
					On the other hand when sidebar is fixed in Firefox,
					text becomes fuzzy,
					and if we apply <code>-moz-backface-visiblity:hidden</code> it gets better
					which again manipulates stacking context (z-index).
					
					<div class="hr hr-6"></div>
					As a result, now fixed sidebar will be above all elements of content area, so 
					you should take care to show dropdowns, popovers or tooltips in a direction which
					don't go below fixed sidebar.
					<br />
					There is an example of changing tooltip direction in <a href="#elements.tooltip.notes" class="help-more">Tooltip section</a>
					
					<div class="hr hr-6"></div>
					
					The only cross-browser workaround to this is to detach a submenu from sidebar on mouse hover,
					append it to body and then put it back in its place on mouseleave.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Old Safari versions have a flickering issue when sidebar has scrollbars and there is an animated icon in content area.
					<br />
					This may not be an issue with updated versions, but Safari for Windows has not been updated for a long time which again is a rarely used browser in Windows.
				</li>
			</ul>
		 </div>
		 
		 
		 <h3 class="info-title smaller">2. Chrome</h3>
		 <div class="info-section">
		    <ul class="info-list list-unstyled">
				<li>
					 Chrome has a problem with responding to click events on Ace buttons becauseo of "move down" effect.
					 <br />
					 I have tried to fix this and its seems to be working now.
					 <br />
					 But if the problem persists you can remove <code>button.btn:active</code> CSS rule
					 inside <code>assets/css/less/buttons.less</code>
					 or <code>assets/css/ace.min.css</code>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Most of the above webkit issues apply to Chrome as well.
				</li>
			</ul>
		 </div>
		 
		 
		 <h3 class="info-title smaller">3. Android Default Browser &amp; Chrome</h3>
		 <div class="info-section">
		    <ul class="info-list list-unstyled">
				<li>
					Android's default browser has an issues with <code>top:auto</code> when
					sidebar or breadcrumbs is fixed
				<li>
				
				<li>
					When sidebar is fixed, document is in RTL mode and there are animated icons inside navbar,
					Android default browser will misplace sidebar.
					<br />
					So you can avoid this by removing animated icons in RTL mode.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Android's default browser doesn't trigger window resize properly when address bar is hidden.
					It's not a big deal
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Chrome Browser on Android, doesn't respond to "mouse hover" events the way
					Android's Default Browser or Android Firefox do.
				</li>
			</ul>
		 </div>
		 
		 
		 <h3 class="info-title smaller">4. iOS Safari</h3>
		 <div class="info-section">
		    <ul class="info-list list-unstyled">
				<li>
					iOS default browser has a problem when you click on sidebar items
					that are hidden at first and are shown when user scrolls down to view them
				</li>
				<li>
					The link receives click event and all handlers are triggered.
					<br />
					It just doesn't navigate to the url.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					So I used <code>document.location = link_element.attr('href')</code>
					to navigate to new url and it works.
					<br />
					But if you are using custom handlers for a link and want to avoid navigation,
					just add <code>data-link="false"</code> attribute to the link to disable navigation:
<pre data-language="html">
<a href="some/path/" data-link="false">
  don't navigate (iOS)
</a>
</pre>
				</li>
				
				
				<li>
					Also when navbar is fixed and an input element receives focus, 
					fixed navbar won't be redrawn.
					<br />
					Currently I have added a workaround which forces redraw of navbar.
				</li>
			</ul>
		 </div>
		 

		 
		 <h3 class="info-title smaller">5. RTL</h3>
		 <div class="info-section">
		    <ul class="info-list list-unstyled">
				<li>
					When using settings box to switch RTL &amp; LTR mode several times,
					some browsers may not redraw elements properly.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					It's not an issue and when you make RTL-specific changes in your server side response,
					browser will render pages correctly.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Also when sidebar is fixed and there are animated icons inside navbar,
					Android default browser will misplace sidebar.
					<br />
					So you can avoid this by removing animated icons in RTL mode.
				</li>
