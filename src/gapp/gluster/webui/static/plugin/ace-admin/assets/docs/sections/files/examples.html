			  I've included some examples which you can find inside <b>examples</b> folder.
			  <br />
			  Some have a server side handler in PHP language.
			  <br />
			  Unfortunately I'm not much familiar with other languages and environments to provide examples for.
			  <br />
			  But if you would like to see more examples, just let me know.
			  
			  <div class="hr hr-12 hr-double"></div>
			   Currently example files are:

			   <ol class="spaced2 margin-20">
				<li>
					File upload example.
					<br />
					<code>examples/file-upload.html</code>
					<br />
					<code>examples/file-upload.php</code>
					<br />
					Fore more info, you can also see <a class="help-more" href="#custom/file-input">file input element</a>.
					
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Profile image update.
					<br />
					The server side code is same as above <code>examples/file-upload.php</code>
					<br />
					If you want to try this on profile page, you should 
					edit profile page, remove the section that says:
					<code><span class="green">// ***UPDATE AVATAR HERE*** //</span></code>
					and use the contents of <code>examples/js/profile-avatar-update.js</code> instead.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Treeview example which uses FuelUX treeview element.
					<br />
					In this example data is loaded from a sqlite database
					<code>examples/data/treeview-city.sqlite</code> and some items are randomly pre-selected.
					<br />
					For instance in your app you may want to display a tree and restore user's previous selection.
					<br />
					Fore more info, you can also see <a class="help-more" href="#plugins/fuelux.treeview">treeview plugin</a>.
