    - errcheck      # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs.
    - errchkjson    # Checks types passed to the json encoding functions. Reports unsupported types and optionally reports occasions, where the check for the returned error can be omitted.
    - funlen        # Tool for detection of long functions
    - gci           # Gci controls golang package import order and makes it always deterministic.
    - goconst       # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
    - gocritic      # Provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues.
    - gofmt         # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification
    - gosimple      # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code
    - govet         # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - misspell      # Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments
    - nolintlint    # Reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
    - revive        # Fast, configurable, extensible, flexible, and beautiful linter for Go. Drop-in replacement of golint.
    - staticcheck   # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary.
    - typecheck     # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - usestdlibvars # A linter that detect the possibility to use variables/constants from the Go standard library.
    - whitespace    # Tool for detection of leading and trailing whitespace
